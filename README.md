Daddel (from German _dadÂ·deln_, meaning _to play_) is a Progressive Web App
(PWA) to organize game nights with your friends. Daddel solves the problem of
finding a date with a large number of people: Users can post match dates for
different games, which others can then join. By specifying the time period in
which each person is available, a useful calendar can be created. This way it is
obvious if and when enough players are interested.
