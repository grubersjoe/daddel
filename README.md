# Daddel

Daddel (from German _dadÂ·deln_, meaning _to play_) let's you plan a gaming
sessions with your friends. Anyone can create matches that can be joined by
others. As each player specifies the time frame in which he is available, the
games are easier to plan. Each lobby has a maximum size dependent on the game.
Right now only _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ is supported, but other games
are planned for the future. Different colors show how full a lobby already is.
